This will be a simple app based on the iPhone game "SoccerStars".

The app will allow the user to play games of "Dragball". Gameplay will entail clicking on a piece that the user controls, and dragging in the opposite direction, with a slingshot style of release and trajectory.

Pieces will bounce off of each other, and the ball will be knocked around the field of play. Friction will be applied on all movement, so that pieces, once in motion, will eventually come to rest.

Pieces will be round, and the angle of the bounces will be as accurate as possible in the given time frame.

Potential components include:
-App
-Board
-Piece
-Ball

...as well as a View component that manages the display of the game.
